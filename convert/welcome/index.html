<h2>￼￼What We’ll Do For You</h2>

<p>We self-identify as a business consultants, not as conversion optimization specialists. I consider this an asset. You’re hiring us for our abilities in business consulting first, and our ability to run an A/B test second.</p>

<p>Towards that end, we value pushing your business to become better and increase revenue and profit, rather than mindlessly seeking ever-better numbers.</p>

<h3>First Things First</h3>

<p>In our first week together, we&rsquo;ll start things off with an initial list of A/B tests that we could potentially work on over the coming months.</p>

<p>Once the list is complete, we&rsquo;ll solicit your feedback on it, and then we’ll plan the first test and its associated goals together.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also ensure we&rsquo;ve added any code necessary to your website and that it&rsquo;s configured correctly.</p>

<p>We add code to your website for one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>run A/B tests,</li>
<li>record visitor data for analysis,</li>
<li>survey your visitors for customer insight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other data you have on your customers would be warmly welcomed, like former survey results and live chat logs for example.</p>

<p>As well, we may request to talk to your sales and customer support teams to extract further information about your customers.</p>

<h3>A/B Tests</h3>

<p>Your average number of tests per month depends on our agreement, the scope of the test (for example, a headline change is easier to create than a wholesale rework or ground-up HTML/CSS development), the amount of traffic you get to that particular page, the conclusiveness of the test’s ￼findings, and the impact of that test across other parts of your conversion funnel (if any).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re very happy to run multiple tests on multiple pages at once—for instance, your home page and a signup page—but you should never run multiple tests on the same page at once, because it&rsquo;ll confound (and prolong) the findings of each.</p>

<p>A test can also contain multiple variations of a page, all measured against the same set of goals. For instance, if you change a headline and a call to action, you&rsquo;ll want four variations of that page, in order to determine the best permutation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Control.</li>
<li>Headline.</li>
<li>Call to action.</li>
<li>Headline + Call to action.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you change a subheader as well, you&rsquo;ll want eight variations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Control.</li>
<li>Headline.</li>
<li>Subheader.</li>
<li>Call to action.</li>
<li>Headline + Call to action.</li>
<li>Headline + Subheader.</li>
<li>Subheader + Call to action.</li>
<li>Headline + Subheader + Call to action.</li>
</ul>

<p>￼In sum, if you make <em>n</em> disparate changes to a page at once, you&rsquo;ll want to serve <em>2n</em> variations, with <em>1⁄2n</em> of total traffic going to each variation. </p>

<p>As a result, we take care in making sure we’re choosing the best things to test each time.</p>

<p>We run tests for as long as it takes to determine whether a given variation will be successful, or whether the test will be inconclusive for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>We run each test for a minimum of two weeks to ensure valid data.</p>

<p>We check in on all Convert tests every week. With each test we determine whether a variation won, or whether we should keep it running a little while longer.</p>

<p>While a test runs, you shouldn’t make any edits to the test page. This could impact our findings in unpredictable ways.</p>

<p>When a test has completed, we&rsquo;ll write a mini report with our thoughts on why the test won or lost. This information helps us in determining what to test next.</p>

<h3>Monthly Reports</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll write up a monthly report that assesses our most recent progress, overall takeaways, and proposes a new round of tests to conduct in the following month. </p>

<p>Reports are posted to Trello, and they’ll occasionally require action on your part, in case we have questions or want to roll successful changes out to every visitor.</p>

<hr>

<h2>￼What We Probably Won’t Do For You</h2>

<p>Although the following things are related to A/B testing, we consider them outside the scope of a Convert engagement:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Traffic generation.</strong> If you aren’t getting enough traffic to your site, you should build your audience before you start A/B testing with it. If you&rsquo;re interested in PPC, we&rsquo;ve worked closely with one particular PPC expert on other client projects and would be happy to chat to you in more detail about your options for PPC.</li>
<li><strong>SEO.</strong> We have a good understanding of the principles of SEO, but if Google moved your site to the second page for some key search terms, you might want to chat with a dedicated SEO consultant before we work together.</li>
<li><strong>Large-scale redesigns.</strong> Actually, we can do one of those, but it would be outside the scope of our typical Convert engagement. If you’re curious about how we’ve planned larger projects with Convert clients, read on!</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>￼What We Can Negotiate</h2>

<p>Convert engagements constitute about half of our time—the rest involves either consulting , writing, or working on boring business-y stuff.</p>

<p>Here’s a story. One of Convert’s clients once confessed that their home page needed a lot of work … and then asked us if we knew of any information architects who might be able to help.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve previously managed single page redesigns to full website and web application design and development. So, not only did we have years of experience in solving their exact problem, but we already knew their business inside and out! The decision to work together was a no-brainer.</p>

<p>And it might be a no-brainer for you, too—someday. While we have a clearly defined scope for our Convert engagements, don’t let that limit your thinking in the future. We’d always be happy to throw together a quote for any other project, from information architecture to content strategy to full website design—and we give priority to Convert clients when determining what we should take on next.</p>

<p>Here are some things we’ve done for Convert clients that have nothing to do with A/B testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wireframed and designed the <a href="https://nerveman.prevue.it/p/r46">application</a> and <a href="https://nerveman.prevue.it/p/lme">marketing website</a> for The Currency Account (previously Wirepayer).</li>
<li>Re-wrote a sales letter to increase direct sales</li>
<li>Designed a Google friendly landing page for a Google AdWords campaign and increased leads by 84%.</li>
<li>Wrote a series of 25 emails for a drip fed marketing campaign.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>￼Onboarding You</h2>

<p>Once you’ve paid, I’ll:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up a Trello board for us to coordinate our activity.</li>
<li>Set up an account for us on Convert.com or Optimizely.com.</li>
<li>Create an initial list of candidates for A/B testing,
metrics that we can use to determine success, and any “quick wins” that can be safely changed without the need to test them (such as typos, bugs, consistency problems, etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>After your first payment, your card will be automatically charged on a monthly basis. In regards to your payments:</p>

<ul>
<li>I try to keep payment as brainlessly automatic as possible.</li>
<li>I use Snappy Checkout, which processes payments through Stripe, a secure and respected payment processor.</li>
<li>Let me know if you ever need to change your billing information. I’ll cancel your existing plan so it no longer bills you there, and you can sign up with your new information whenever it’s convenient.</li>
<li>Currently I don’t accept other forms of payment for Convert engagements.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>￼Our Tools</h2>

<p>We’ll be using a few tools to roll out tests, make changes, and coordinate our work together.</p>

<h3>Trello</h3>

<p>We’ll use Trello to post reports, coordinate on future tests, notify each other of our availability, and critique our work together. Trello is a great email substitute, because it ensures a long-lasting, group-visible record of all our work together.</p>

<p>I’m happy to invite as many people as appropriate to Trello; just let me know their email addresses. (You can also invite them yourself.)</p>

<p>I’ll be adding a few documents to Trello as we get started:</p>

<ul>
<li>A plan for what tests might be viable in the future, to be maintained by myself and whomever else wants to brainstorm.</li>
<li>A list of goals that we should be tracking.</li>
<li>Future vacation days.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;re happy to work with all types of client, no matter how hands-on they are. We have clients who are entirely hands-off, letting me test as needed and offering minimal feedback.</p>

<p>We also have clients who go so far as to mark up their own screenshots. Most are somewhere in the middle, providing some feedback after they see how the work has progressed.</p>

<h3>Convert.com and Optimizely.com</h3>

<p>Unless you have your own A/B testing account, we&rsquo;ll use one of our accounts at Convert.com or Optimizely.com.</p>

<p>You’ll be given access to the account to view test results, but we’ll have access to make changes to the tests themselves.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be required to add a snippet of JavaScript to all pages that you want to test. Please do this before we kick off our first test.</p>

<h3>Analytics tools</h3>

<p>Before we begin our first A/B test, we&rsquo;d like to be granted access to your analytics tools.</p>

<p>You can give Google Analytics access to <a href="mailto:hello@davidcrowther.com">hello@davidcrowther.com</a> and <a href="mailto:emils@davidcrowther.com">emils@davidcrowther.com</a>. </p>

<p>Access to other analytics suites (KISSmetrics, Mixpanel, Mint, etc.) also use <a href="mailto:hello@davidcrowther.com">hello@davidcrowther.com</a> and <a href="mailto:emils@davidcrowther.com">emils@davidcrowther.com</a>.</p>

<p>This is so we can determine how your conversion funnels are working, and what pages are getting enough traffic to perform statistically significant tests. We pay careful attention to your analytics as we put together tests and take action on future changes.</p>

<h3>Rolling out changes</h3>

<p>After enough time, we’ll have a successful test, and we’ll want to roll a variant’s changes out to everyone. This means we’ll have to make changes to the site itself. </p>

<p>We’ve found that things move much faster if you give me GitHub, Subversion, WordPress admin, and/or FTP access to your site, so we can make these changes as needed.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to give us this kind of access, I understand, but do keep in mind that our ability to move forward will be constrained by your ability to roll changes out quickly. </p>

<p>Either way, we’ll keep you apprised of all successful tests and their attendant changes on Trello.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Our Availability</h2>

<p>We work Monday through Friday, between 12pm and 10pm GMT/UTC (<a href="http://everytimezone.com">compare your timezone to ours</a>). If you contact us outside of those times, we might not respond as quickly as usual.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to have a chat, it&rsquo;s best to <a href="http://www.davidcrowther.com/book-appointment/">book a time</a>.</p>

<p>Like everybody, we also take vacation from time to time. Barring any personal emergencies, you’ll know about our vacation plans at least one month in advance. </p>

<p>Expect intermittent availability around most British holidays like Christmas, New Year’s, Queen&rsquo;s Birthday and other public holidays.</p>

<hr>

<h2>A Few Questions You Might Have</h2>

<h4>We get over 50,000 visitors per month. Is Convert a good fit for us?</h4>

<p>Yes! Any site can be A/B tested, and it’s great that you&rsquo;re already gathering a ton of valuable data. That said, Convert.com and Optimizely.com monthly plans limit the number of visitors that we can test with, and we&rsquo;re operating under that constraint when we work with everyone. There are a couple of ways we could take care of this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Limit the proportion of users that see a test. This can reduce the number of overall hits we get billed for. The downside of this, of course, is that a test will take that much longer.</li>
<li>Sign up for a separate A/B testing account, and give me access to it. This will result in more, better, and faster tests, but you will have to pay for it. At your scale, you might want to speak with Convert.com or Optimizely.com for a larger plan. Both of them have great plans that support over 100,000 page views per month.</li>
</ul>

<h4>I don’t want to use Convert.com or Optimizely.com. Can we go with a different A/B testing app?</h4>

<p>Sure, but Convert comes with Convert.com or Optimizely.com for free, not any other testing framework. If you want to use a different framework or a larger plan, you’ll need to pay for and maintain it yourself. We’ll create the tests in whatever you’re happiest using, just give us access and we can take it from there.</p>

<h4>Why doesn’t Convert.com or Optimizely.com&rsquo;s reported data match my internal analytics?</h4>

<p>There are a lot of technical reasons for this, which is partly why Convert.com, Optimizely.com and other A/B testing suites work in terms of statistical confidence. Tests that finish with 90% confidence still have a 10% chance of not providing some measurable improvement.</p>

<h4>Can we test mobile sites as well?</h4>

<p>Yes! We love testing mobile and responsive sites. But testing native apps is outside of scope.</p>

<h4> I noticed you increased your rates on Convert’s home page. Will I pay that much someday?</h4>

<p>No. All Convert clients are grandfathered in at whatever rate they started at. Our rate is based on the value that we provide most of our clients, so it might change for future clients. Higher rates also allow us to develop a better, more stable set of clients.</p>

<p>Please note: if you want to put our work on hold for a few months, when we begin working together again, we’ll ask for whatever the current rate is. We believe that’s the fairest policy for my business and our other clients.</p>

<h4>But won’t I get worse service than somebody who pays more?</h4>

<p>No. We treat everybody the same: again, it’s about being fair to all of our clients. We work as hard as we can for all of our Convert clients.</p>

<hr>

<h2>￼Conclusion</h2>

<p>And that’s it! I hope this provided some helpful context. If you still have some questions, don&rsquo;t hesitate to pop me an email at <a href="mailto:hello@davidcrowther.com">hello@davidcrowther.com</a>. Thanks again for your interest!</p>

<p>Kind regards,<br>
