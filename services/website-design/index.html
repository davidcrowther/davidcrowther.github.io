  <h6>Your website has a specific purpose—you want either leads or customers—that&rsquo;s why our number one goal is to increase the number of conversions you get from your website.</h6>

<p><img src="/assets/flat-wireframes-orange-400.png" alt="Wireframes" style="float:right; padding-left:20px; padding-bottom:20px;" />UX or User Experience Design is all about creating beautiful designs that not only look good, but are based on data, proven design principles, in-depth industry knowledge, and extensive testing and research.</p>

<p>If you’re not comfortable with this approach to design, and would rather go with your “gut feeling” or personal design preferences, we’re not a good fit for you.</p>

<p>It’s not that we’re arrogant—running tests and measuring real world use is humbling. You quickly learn that opinions don’t make money.</p>

<h2>An Overview of Our Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Design Process</h2>

<h4>1. Research and Analysis:</h4>

<p>Define your business and website goals, evaluate your website, study the information you send us, search the web for additional information, analyse your website analytics and review your competitors websites.</p>

<h4>2. Information Architecture:</h4>

<p>Information architecture is the art and science of figuring out what you want your site to do and then constructing a plan of how we&rsquo;ll achieve that goal. We&rsquo;ll create a site map and sometimes user journeys (flowcharts) when required.</p>

<h4>3. Direct Response Copywriting</h4>

<p>Great copy is the workhorse behind your conversions and this paired with the right design can amplify your conversions with a cumulative effect.</p>

<h4>4. Design:</h4>

<p>Based on our research and analysis, We&rsquo;ll create wireframes that outline the structure and layout of your new pages. The wireframes are then transformed into beautiful and functional designs.</p>

<h4>5. Development (optional)</h4>

<p>The new design is carefully crafted pixel by pixel into clean HTML, CSS and Javascript code and then tested across the four main browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome &amp; IE). We also offer ‘Responsive design’ so that your pages look and work great on tablet and mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Case Study One</h2>

<p>The Currency Account required a website to promote their new currency exchange service. As part of the project we created their marketing website from scratch as well as designing the user interface for their new service.</p>

<p>After our research we created over 90 wireframes with multiple revisions before we even thought about designing the first page.</p>

<h6>We noticed an immediate increase in conversion …</h6>
<p>Our site had been struggling with conversion and after numerous iterations and working with different web development firms we decided to hire David.</p>

<p>David did significant research on our competition and worked with us to immediately identify our key selling points and successfully position our story and product.</p>

<p>The landing page provided by David was of the highest quality we had seen in our space and included excellent copy. We noticed an immediate increase in conversion after launching the page.</p>

<p>David was a pleasure to work with and we highly recommend David for any website conversion or optimization. We will definitely be using David again for future web development.</p>

<h2>Set Your Expectations</h2>

<p>Even the best design is a hypothesis—one that needs to be tested in the real world. </p>

<p>Whether this is a new website or a redesign of an existing website, you should know that this is just the first step in your optimization process.</p>

<p>Often once the new website is live, tweaks will need to be made based on the data that has been gathered. This is normal and to be expected.</p>

<p>Your website should be an ongoing process of continuous improvement. Just like any other part of your business, your website needs attention and nurturing to grow and prosper.</p>

<p>As part of our service, we include as standard a three month <a href="http://www.davidcrowther.com/convert/">continuous optimization plan</a> following the launch of your new website.</p>

<h2>Case Study Two</h2>

<p>Sharenet were looking to increase the sales of their stock exchange course and their current website looked old and tired.</p>

<p>After our research we created a modern design focused on selling their main products.</p>

<h4>Old design (click to view full size):</h4>

<h4>The results:</h4>

<p>We increased click-throughs to their order page by 2933%.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:40px;"><img src="/assets/sharenet-test-results.png" style="border:5px solid #212E3B;"></p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>We work with all types of websites from landing pages to full ecommerce stores.</p>

<p>We provide the copy, the design, the front end coding, and when required the back end coding.</p>

<p>Hosting is not included, but we&rsquo;re happy to provide recommendations based on your requirements.</p>

<div class="testimonial" style="margin-top:60px;margin-bottom:60px;">
<blockquote>
<h2>10% Lift Guarantee</h2>
<p>If you have an existing website that receives over 10,000 visitors per month, we&rsquo;re happy to offer a guarantee.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll achieve a minimum 10% lift in your conversion rate or revenue within three months from launch, or you&rsquo;ll receive continued testing and optimization at no cost until the 10% lift is attained.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>What is a site map?</strong><br>
A site map defines the structure and hierarchy of your website. It also creates the taxonomy, or the names for your websites sections and pages.</p>

<p><strong>What is a user journey?</strong><br>
A user journey, usually presented as a flow chart, shows the anticipated or ideal path the visitor will take travelling through your website. It’s important to work out how the lead or sales funnel will work to optimize conversions.</p>

<p><strong>How many concepts or mockups do you design?</strong><br>
Just the one per page, but it’s the one we believe is the best to increase your conversions.</p>

<p><strong>How many revisions do I get for each wireframe or design?</strong><br>
You may have up to 3 revisions on the copy, 3 revisions on each wireframe and 3 revisions on each design. Additional revisions can still be requested, but will incur an additional fee.</p>

<p><strong>What if I don’t like the finished design?</strong><br>
Design is a personal thing and everyone has their opinions of what looks good. We design based on data and results and that takes precedence over certain design trends. If you feel this will be an issue, we may not be the best fit for you.</p>

<p><strong>How do we tell if the new design worked?</strong><br>
If you have over 10,000 monthly visitors, we run what’s called an A/B test between the old design and the new design. When we run the test, the traffic is split evenly between the old and new website and any conversions are recorded.</p>

<p><strong>So what happens if your design doesn’t increase my conversion rate?</strong><br>
If you qualify for our guarantee and we&rsquo;ve tested your new design against the old, we&rsquo;ll analyse the results of the first A/B test and create you a new design. This is all included and free of charge.</p>

<p><strong>Can you code the new design as well?</strong><br>
Yes, if required each design can be carefully crafted pixel by pixel into clean HTML, CSS and Javascript code and then tested across the four main browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome &amp; IE). We also provide ‘Responsive design’ as standard so that your pages look and work great on tablets and mobiles.</p>

<p><strong>Can you integrate the new design into my CMS?</strong><br>
Yes we can. Just let us know the details of your CMS and we&rsquo;ll include it in your quote.</p>

<p><strong>Do you offer website hosting?</strong><br>
No, but we&rsquo;re happy to recommend a hosting provider to fit your needs.</p>
