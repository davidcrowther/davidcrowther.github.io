  <p><em>Created for Jeff Giesea by <a href="/about/">David Crowther</a></em></p>

<p><em>7 January 2015</em></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re looking to create a information product that helps people increase their success rate when searching for their next job. Career coaching as a packaged product.</p>

<p>To provide this service you&rsquo;re looking to create a membership based ecourse and community using Ruzuku.com</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve broken the work down into two-three stages and have provided details and pricing for the first stage only.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to expand on each stage verbally when we chat or feel free to email me your questions to <a href="mailto:hello@davidcrowther.com">hello@davidcrowther.com</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Traffic</h2>

<p>There are a number of marketing channels to choose from and I&rsquo;ve listed the main ones below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Viral Marketing</li>
<li>Public Relations (PR)</li>
<li>Unconventional PR</li>
<li>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</li>
<li>Social &amp; Display Ads</li>
<li>Offline Ads</li>
<li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
<li>Content Marketing (Inbound Marketing)</li>
<li>Email Marketing</li>
<li>Engineering as Marketing (See <a href="http://themakerscrew.com/engineeringasmarketing.html">http://themakerscrew.com/engineeringasmarketing.html</a> for examples)</li>
<li>Targeting Blogs</li>
<li>Business Development (BD)</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Affiliate Programs</li>
<li>Existing Platforms</li>
<li>Trade Shows</li>
<li>Offline Events</li>
<li>Speaking Engagements</li>
<li>Community Building</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Recommendations</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stage One:</strong> To generate immediate traffic go with &lsquo;paid advertising&rsquo; using Google AdWords, LinkedIn Ads and Facebook Ads. This will allow you to get immediate feedback on your idea and your initial sales funnel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stage Two:</strong> Secondly focus on &lsquo;content marketing&rsquo;, primarily through blogging and expanding your audience using guest blogging and social media.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stage Three:</strong> Direct sales (outplacement and career services)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I would also recommend &lsquo;email marketing&rsquo;, as part of the whole sales funnel.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sales Funnel</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the sales process I would look to implement to maximize sales and revenue.</p>

<h3>My Recommendations</h3>

<p>Start immediately with just a landing page and email course. This allows you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>immediately validate your idea (do you have something people want),</li>
<li>optimise your paid advertising campaigns,</li>
<li>optimise your landing page,</li>
<li>solicit feedback from prospective customers via customer survey, </li>
<li>build your email list.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that while you&rsquo;re still building your actual service.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/flowchart-60dayjobsearch.png" alt="Sales Funnel Flowchart"> </p>

<p>The following system for stage one is based on the assumption you&rsquo;re following my recommendations and proceeding with paid advertising.</p>

<h3>The Landing Page</h3>

<p>Before any generation of traffic we must first create the destination. This is in the form of a landing page which you can also use as your initial home page for your new website.</p>

<p>The landing page has a clear purpose which is to entice the user to sign up to your email course. So, when you create the landing page you must:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Have a visitor in mind</strong> (your target audience).</li>
<li><strong>Establish an immediate understanding with the visitor.</strong> You should lead with something that is widely accepted and resonant with the visitor. Your lead should immediately capture their attention.</li>
<li><strong>Address all prospective objections</strong> that the visitor may have.</li>
<li><strong>Define the scope.</strong> What are you offering? Is there a cost? How much does the customer get for their money? When should they expect to receive it? Now&rsquo;s a good time to figure out these details—as they&rsquo;ll factor strongly into your sales pitch.</li>
<li><strong>Close with the offer.</strong> Don&rsquo;t do this at the beginning. You want to get people excited before you mention your offer.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a next step.</strong> Let them enter their email address to access the email course.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The home page will be laid out in the following format:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Bold headline</li>
<li>Sub-headline</li>
<li>Bulleted list</li>
<li>Possible call-to-action that links to form down the page*</li>
<li>Personal story with photo of owner</li>
</ul>

<p>*It may also be worth testing a two column layout with the form in the right hand column. Example: <a href="http://drop.davidcrowther.com/202425/3843483">http://drop.davidcrowther.com/202425/3843483</a></p>

<h3>The Sales Page</h3>

<p>Once the visitor has signed up to the email course, they are directed to the sales page—after all, they&rsquo;ve just given you their email address so let&rsquo;s capitalise on their giving mood.</p>

<h4>The sales page will continue educating them about your service and will include the following:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>How it work</strong>s - how your service works ideally in three simple steps</li>
<li><strong>Testimonials / Case studies / Reviews</strong> (we can add these in later)</li>
<li><strong>What you can expect</strong> – people like to know what to expect, it makes them feel more secure in what they&rsquo;re doing.</li>
<li><strong>Our services are not for you if …</strong> uses the old &lsquo;you want what you can&rsquo;t have&rsquo; psychology trick as well as weeding out the people who aren&rsquo;t in your target market.</li>
<li><strong>Guarantee</strong> – See why you should offer a guarantee at <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/02/09/a-question-of-money-back-guarantees-and-marketing-your-online-products/">http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/02/09/a-question-of-money-back-guarantees-and-marketing-your-online-products/</a></li>
<li><strong>Plans &amp; Pricing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Limited Offer</strong> (time or quantity) – after they&rsquo;ve just signed up to your email course we give them a time or quantity limited offer of a discount to the paid service. Creates a sense of urgency and special status.</li>
<li><strong>FAQs</strong> – here&rsquo;s where you answer every conceivable objection you think someone may have about using your service.</li>
<li><strong>P.S.</strong> – People can&rsquo;t resist reading the P.S. so take advantage of this and repeat your call to action here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Email Course</h3>

<p>As soon as a visitor has signed up for the email course on the landing page they&rsquo;re sent a welcome email which:</p>

<ul>
<li>is warm and friendly like a personal note to a friend,</li>
<li>lays out what to expect from the course,</li>
<li>reminds them about the time or quantity limited discount on offer (including a direct link to the sales page).</li>
<li>and also asks them to white list you.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can make the email course as long as you like but I recommend a minimum of five emails in your course.</p>

<p>Also, include one or more &lsquo;bonus&rsquo; emails as it follows the under promise, over deliver theme which is always a winner.</p>

<p><strong>In choosing an email service provider (ESP) I recommend Customer.io or GetDrip.com</strong> as they allow you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Send normal email campaigns like you would with MailChimp.</li>
<li>Send autoresponder campaign, also like MailChimp does.</li>
<li>But you can also segment subscribers and trigger campaigns based on events. Events can be any action taken by users like when someone upgrades to a paid account, clicks on a link in an email, or even when they take no action like sending a member a reminder email  if they have a period of inactivity.</li>
<li>You can also A/B test every emails subject line and email content—this is very useful and something you should always be doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows you to send the right messages to the right people at the right time.</p>

<h4>Email marketing tip</h4>

<p>For all your email campaigns, I would highly recommend plain text emails (or HTML that looks like a plain text email) over image based emails. For the majority of the tests I&rsquo;ve performed, the plain text version was the winner. </p>

<p>If you think about all the emails you&rsquo;ve received that had images, I bet they were trying to sell you something. This association has made people immediately wary with image based emails. </p>

<p>The plain text email in comparison—like the ones you receive from your friends and family—you&rsquo;re happy to read first and then make judgment.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<ul>
<li>PPC: $500-$1,000 per month + your advertising budget.</li>
<li>Landing page: $1,000</li>
<li>Sales page: $1,500</li>
<li>Email course: $700 for 5 emails or $1,200 for 10 emails or $2,000 for 20 emails </li>
</ul>

<p>A fixed monthly fee for PPC can be provided upon request once further research has been preformed. The PPC platforms required will also need to be defined.</p>

<p>Copywriting, design and front end coding is included in the landing and sales pages. We will also integrate subscription forms to your email service provider.</p>

<p>Emails in the email course will look like plain text but will be created in HTML for tracking purposes. The fee includes adding the emails to the email service provider of your choice.</p>

<p>Hosting is not included.</p>

<p>A 50% deposit will be required.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Further Recommendations</h2>

<p><strong>Find a friend or colleague and offer to walk them through your service for free.</strong> Most people won&rsquo;t say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this.</p>

<p>In return, you agree that they&rsquo;ll give you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uncensored feedback. Your guinea pig needs to tear your offering apart. What did they like? What would they improve? Get as much detailed, actionable feedback as possible. Get them on a phone call or take them for coffee if you need to. And never stop asking questions.</li>
<li>A testimonial. You want a testimonial to display on the sales page. During the feedback, make sure you take note of anything positive, write it down, and compile a testimonial for the person. Nobody likes writing testimonials, so you write down what they said, repeat it back to them, and ask to use it as a testimonial.</li>
<li>Experience. Review the process, expand on what worked, weed out what didn&rsquo;t and refine your offering even further before you launch.</li>
</ul>
