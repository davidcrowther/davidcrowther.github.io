<h6>Continuous improvements to the copy and design of your landing page can make major and lasting improvements to your sales and revenue.</h6>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know already, Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), is the process of analyzing, updating and testing changes to your website to increase your conversion rates.</p>

<p>A part of CRO is A/B testing in which we create two (or more) different versions of your landing page, measure which performs best, and then implement the winning version.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Testing works. If you&rsquo;re not doing it well, you&rsquo;re missing out. Your website can (and should) get better. Every single day.&rdquo;
– Seth Godin, Author &amp; Marketing Guru</p>

<p>But how do you know what to change? What would you change it to? And how can you measure whether those changes were effective?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where I come in.</p>

<h3>My Process to Increase Your Conversions:</h3>

<h5>1. Research and Analysis:</h5>

<p>I study the information you send me, search the web for additional information, analyse your website and review your competitors websites.</p>

<h5>2. Direct Response Copywriting</h5>

<p>Great copy is the workhorse behind your conversions and this paired with the right design can amplify your conversions with a cumulative effect.</p>

<h5>3. Design:</h5>

<p>Based on my research and analysis, I create wireframes that outline the structure and layout of your new page/s. I then work with my team of designers to design the new page.</p>

<h5>4. Testing:</h5>

<p>We can talk about theories and best practices all we want, but until we actually test what we create, we&rsquo;ve no idea if we&rsquo;re moving the needle forward.</p>

<p>So I run an A/B test between the original version and the new. If I&rsquo;ve created something new that didn&rsquo;t exist before, we monitor your higher end goals to measure improvement. This is the only way to be sure the changes are successful and is why I&rsquo;m happy to offer a guarantee on all my work (see more on this below).</p>

<p>To run these tests on your website I use services like <a href="http://convert.com">http://convert.com</a> and <a href="https://www.optimizely.com">https://www.optimizely.com</a></p>

<hr>

<h3>What You Get:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Up to 2,500 words that are focused on converting more visitors into customers.</li>
<li>UX design that builds upon the new copy.</li>
<li>A/B test to confirm an increase in conversions.</li>
</ul>

<p>To view examples of the designs we&rsquo;ve done, check out <a href="http://drop.davidcrowther.com/202425">http://drop.davidcrowther.com/202425</a></p>

<hr>

<h3>10% Lift Guarantee:</h3>

<p>If you have an existing landing page receiving over 5,000 visitors per month, I guarantee I&rsquo;ll achieve a minimum 10% lift in your conversion rate, or you&rsquo;ll receive continued optimization and testing at no cost until the 10% lift is attained. This is a minimum. I normally achieve between 50% to 300% improvement in conversion rates.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Case Studies:</h3>

<ul>
<li>For a stock trading course, I increased click-throughs by a massive 2933% – see <a href="http://www.davidcrowther.com/work/sharenet">http://www.davidcrowther.com/work/sharenet</a></li>
<li>For a volunteer abroad organization I increased their enquiries by 310% – see <a href="http://www.davidcrowther.com/work/ifre">http://www.davidcrowther.com/work/ifre</a></li>
<li>For a life insurance client I increased leads by 84% – see <a href="http://www.davidcrowther.com/work/ileads">http://www.davidcrowther.com/work/ileads</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>How Much Is This?</h3>

<p>Let’s picture these three scenarios based on an average of 15,000 visitors per month and a profit of $300 per sale:</p>

<p>We increase your conversion rate from 0.25% to 0.3% (a 20% increase) which brings in an additional <em>$2,250 profit per month</em>.</p>

<p>We increase your conversion rate from 0.25% to 0.4% (a 60% increase) which brings in an additional <em>$6,750 profit per month</em>.</p>

<p>We increase your conversion rate from 0.25% to 0.5% (a 100% increase) which brings in an additional <em>$11,250 profit per month</em>.</p>

<p><strong>=&gt; What you pay: $1,250</strong></p>

<p>*Note: lead generation pages start at $950 for up to 500 words. Sales pages which are up to 2,500 words are required when you&rsquo;re asking the visitor to open their wallet and purchase a product or service.</p>

<p>Want more than 1 landing page?</p>

<p>Additional landing pages based on the first landing page design are available for a reduced fee: $200 – $500 per page depending on the size and number of changes required.</p>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>

<h5>How many concepts or mockups do you design?</h5>

<p>Just the one unless we’ve agreed otherwise, but it’s the one I believe is the best to increase your conversions, so much so that I offer a guarantee.</p>

<h5>How many revisions do I get on my design?</h5>

<p>You may have up to 2 revisions on the copy and 2 revisions on the design.</p>

<h5>What if I don’t like the finished design?</h5>

<p>This rarely happens as we work closely with you throughout the process, adjusting the design based on your feedback. If you still don’t like the design AND it’s doesn’t increase your conversion rate, then I have no problem trying again with a new design.</p>

<h5>How do we tell if the new design worked?</h5>

<p>For those who have over 5,000 visitors per month, we run what’s called an A/B test between the old design and the new design. When we run the test, the traffic is split evenly between the old and new landing pages and any conversions are recorded.</p>

<h5>So what happens if your design doesn’t increase my conversion rate (for those who have over 5,000 visitors per month)?</h5>

<p>We try again. I analyse the results of the first A/B test and create a new design. This is all included and free of charge. If we repetitively fail to increase your conversion rate (which hasn’t happened yet) then we offer you the 80% refund.</p>

<h5>Do you code the new design as well?</h5>

<p>No, coding is not included. I have a few developers that I&rsquo;ve worked with closely over the years and will happily pass on their contact details.</p>

<h5>Can you integrate the new design into my CMS?</h5>

<p>No, but I have a few developers that I&rsquo;ve worked with closely over the years and will happily pass on their contact details.</p>

<h5>Do you offer hosting for the landing page?</h5>

<p>No, but I’m happy to recommend a hosting provider to fit your needs.</p>
