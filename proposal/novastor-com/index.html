<p><img src="/assets/ab_test.png" alt="A/B Test" style="float:right; padding-left:20px; padding-bottom:20px;" />Continuous small improvements to the copy and design of your website can make major and lasting improvements to your sales and revenue.</p>

<p>Called Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), this process consists of analyzing, updating and testing changes to your website to increase your conversion rates.</p>

<p>A/B testing really is a simple concept. Create two (or more) different versions of a page on your website, measure which performs best, and then implement the winning version.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Companies are spending too much money on acquiring customers. Successful conversion means maximizing the value from every customer visit and ensuring they always come back for more.”<br>
<em>– Dr. Tal Schwartz, Founder and CEO, ClickTale</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is what your competition knows that you don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Increasing your conversion rates <strong>increases your profit</strong> without spending more on advertising.</li>
<li>Having higher conversion rates opens up new advertising channels that weren&rsquo;t available to you before because of your <strong>increased return on advertising spend (ROAS)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But how do you know what to change? What would you change it to? And how can you measure whether those changes were effective?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where I come in.</p>

<hr>

<h3>My Process to Increase Your Conversions:</h3>

<h5>1. Evaluate</h5>

<p>First we discover (not guess) which parts of your business are under-performing and why. We analyse your analytics, your sales funnel, perform usability tests, talk to your customers, talk to your team and review your competition.</p>

<p>Having a &ldquo;fresh pair of eyes&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t be underestimated in this crucial stage.</p>

<p>We then define your business goals and how they translate into your website goals, and decide how you’ll measure success. We need to define the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will ensure you meet your goals.</p>

<h5>2. Plan</h5>

<p>Next we create your optimization strategy. We write a list of A/B tests we want to preform, then prioritize it to pick the low hanging fruit first.</p>

<h5>3. Testing</h5>

<p>We can talk about theories and best practices all we want, but until we actually test what we create, we&rsquo;ve no idea if we&rsquo;re moving the needle forward or backward.</p>

<p>So for every update I make to your copy and/or design, I run an A/B test between the original version and the new. </p>

<p>If I&rsquo;ve created something new that didn&rsquo;t exist before, we monitor your higher end goals to measure improvement. This is the only way to be sure the changes are successful and is why I&rsquo;m happy to offer a guarantee on all my work (see more on this below).</p>

<p>To run these tests on your website I use services like <a href="http://www.convert.com/">convert.com</a> and <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">optimizely.com</a>.</p>

<h5>4. Review &amp; Repeat</h5>

<p>After testing comes the review. Did the changes make a positive improvement?</p>

<p>If yes, great! We move onto the next area of the sales funnel we want to improve and start at the beginning of this process again.</p>

<p>If not, we dig deep into the results and uncover the reasons why. We then take these lessons and apply them as we start the process over again.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>10% Lift Guarantee</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll achieve a minimum 10% lift in your conversion rate or revenue within three months, or you&rsquo;ll receive continued testing and optimization at no cost until the 10% lift is attained. This is a minimum. I normally achieve between 50% to 300% improvement in conversion rates.</p>

<h3>How Much Is This?</h3>

<p>Let’s picture these 3 scenarios based on an average of 15,000 visitors per month, a current conversion rate of 4.75% and an average order size of $96:</p>

<ul>
<li>We increase your conversion rate from 4.75% to 5.25% (a 11% increase) which brings in an additional $7,200 per month.</li>
<li>We increase your conversion rate from 4.75% to 6% (a 26% increase) which brings in an additional $18,000 per month.</li>
<li>We increase your conversion rate from 4.75% to 7% (a 47% increase) which brings in an additional $32,400 per month.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_ftagjErLL3qeRmNR3DKtqQfZGOOTvTyEZz50Rs0bKc/edit?usp=sharing">View the calculations</a>.</p>

<p>I’d like to work with you for an initial three-month engagement to determine whether we&rsquo;re a good fit.</p>

<p>I’ll spend a 1-2 days every month analyzing all your data, writing up the report, and chatting with you to discuss changes as necessary. This is cheaper than my usual day rate, but as it&rsquo;s an ongoing partnership, I’m willing to provide a discount for it.</p>

<p>And of course there&rsquo;s my 10% Lift Guarantee (see above).</p>

<h6><em>Convert</em> is affordable at just <strong>$1250</strong> per month.</h6>

<hr>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>

<p><strong>Q: How long will take to see results?</strong><br>
A: Depending on what&rsquo;s required, you normally see results around the second or third month.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Who will write the copy or create the designs when making the changes to my website?</strong><br>
A: Copywriting, design and front end coding are all included in the fee. If any updates requires changes to the back end we will discuss this with you and plan the best course of action together.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What happens when we get a positive result from an A/B test?</strong><br>
A: First we give each other a round of high fives … then we start a new test. Optimization is an ongoing process and there are many ways we can increase your sales and revenue.</p>

<h6>David wasn’t afraid to push back on the accepted literature in the market …</h6>
<p>I worked with David using email and specific landing pages for user acquisition. David was extremely creative and suggested strategies that ran contrary to norms in the design of emails, the amount of information conveyed and the time and day the message was sent. </p>

<p>He understood the degree of explanation required to create trust and tested iterations across multiple times and days.</p> 

<p>As a result of his work, we created a mix of long and short form emails sent at different times to optimize open and click through rates. </p>

<p>David wasn’t afraid to push back on the accepted literature in the market. And, he was polite and firm all along the way. I appreciate his help and continued insight.</p>
