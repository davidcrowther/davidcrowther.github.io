<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve broken down this marketing plan into the following four sections:</p>

<ol>
<li>Channels</li>
<li>Processes</li>
<li>Measurement &amp; Analysis</li>
<li>Further Recommendations</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to expand on each section verbally when we chat or feel free to email me your questions to <a href="mailto:hello@davidcrowther.com">hello@davidcrowther.com</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Channels</h2>

<p>There are a number of marketing channels to choose from and I&rsquo;ve listed the main ones below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Viral Marketing</li>
<li>Public Relations (PR)</li>
<li>Unconventional PR</li>
<li>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</li>
<li>Social &amp; Display Ads</li>
<li>Offline Ads</li>
<li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
<li>Content Marketing (Inbound Marketing)</li>
<li>Email Marketing</li>
<li>Engineering as Marketing (See <a href="http://themakerscrew.com/engineeringasmarketing.html">http://themakerscrew.com/engineeringasmarketing.html</a> for examples)</li>
<li>Targeting Blogs</li>
<li>Business Development (BD)</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Affiliate Programs</li>
<li>Existing Platforms</li>
<li>Trade Shows</li>
<li>Offline Events</li>
<li>Speaking Engagements</li>
<li>Community Building</li>
</ul>

<h4>As most small businesses don&rsquo;t have the time or budget to test all of these channels, we need to rank or prioritise them based on:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Suitability and likability</li>
<li>Budget</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Can it be automated</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have your prioritised list, select the first channel to focus on and hit hard.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the ability to scale at this point as you want to be doing things that don&rsquo;t necessarily scale. For more information about this see <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/non-scaleable-growth-tactics">https://www.groovehq.com/blog/non-scaleable-growth-tactics</a> and <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3589-why-were-doing-things-that-dont-scale">https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3589-why-were-doing-things-that-dont-scale</a></p>

<p>Also, be aware that with some channels it is quite common to be unprofitable at first, but with some optimisation you can soon be producing a healthy return. PPC is a prime suspect for this.</p>

<h4>Once you have enough data to determine if this channel is profitable (or will be in the near future), go through the following checklist:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Can this channel be automated? If yes, write out the process. If no, goto point number 2.</li>
<li>Can this channel be outsourced? If yes, write out the role description and requirements. In no, goto point number 3.</li>
<li>Is it profitable for me to work on this channel myself at the moment? If yes, continue as you are and re-assess in three months time.</li>
</ol>

<p>You then move onto the next channel in your list with the goal of systematically testing the top five channels in your list.</p>

<h4>So, what are we looking out for in each channel? The following helps you determine which channels to stick with:</h4>

<ul>
<li>the cost per customer acquisition,</li>
<li>the market size (how many people are available to connect with in this market),</li>
<li>are they the right type of people you should be connecting with (your ideal customers).</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Recommendations</h3>

<p>To generate immediate traffic go with &lsquo;paid advertising&rsquo; using Google AdWords, LinkedIn Ads and Facebook Ads.</p>

<p>This will allow you to get immediate feedback on your idea and your initial sales funnel.</p>

<p>Secondly focus on &lsquo;content marketing&rsquo;, primarily through blogging and expanding your audience using guest blogging and social media.</p>

<p>Then combine both these channels with a third channel which is &lsquo;email marketing&rsquo;, as part of the whole sales funnel.</p>

<p>In the next stage I will outline the steps to create your sales funnels using these channels.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Processes</h2>

<p>The following system is based on the assumption you&rsquo;re following my recommendations and proceeding with paid advertising and content marketing.</p>

<h3>The Landing Page</h3>

<p>Before any generation of traffic we must first create the destination. This is in the form of a landing page which you can also use as your initial home page for your new website.</p>

<p>The landing page has a clear purpose which is to entice the user to sign up to your email course. So, when you create the landing page you must:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Have a visitor in mind</strong> (your target audience).</li>
<li><strong>Establish an immediate understanding with the visitor.</strong> You should lead with something that is widely accepted and resonant with the visitor. Your lead should immediately capture their attention.</li>
<li><strong>Address all prospective objections</strong> that the visitor may have.</li>
<li><strong>Define the scope.</strong> What are you offering? Is there a cost? How much does the customer get for their money? When should they expect to receive it? Now&rsquo;s a good time to figure out these details—as they&rsquo;ll factor strongly into your sales pitch.</li>
<li><strong>Close with the offer.</strong> Don&rsquo;t do this at the beginning. You want to get people excited before you mention your offer.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a next step.</strong> Let them enter their email address to access the email course.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The home page will be laid out in the following format:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Bold headline</li>
<li>Sub-headline</li>
<li>Bulleted list</li>
<li>Possible call-to-action that links to form down the page*</li>
<li>Personal story with photo of owner</li>
</ul>

<p>*It may also be worth testing a two column layout with the form in the right hand column. Example: <a href="http://drop.davidcrowther.com/202425/3843483">http://drop.davidcrowther.com/202425/3843483</a></p>

<h3>The Sales Page</h3>

<p>Once the visitor has signed up to the email course, they are directed to the sales page—after all, they&rsquo;ve just given you their email address so let&rsquo;s capitalise on their giving mood.</p>

<h4>The sales page will continue educating them about your service and will include the following:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>How it work</strong>s - how your service works ideally in three simple steps</li>
<li><strong>Testimonials / Case studies / Reviews</strong> (we can add these in later)</li>
<li><strong>What you can expect</strong> – people like to know what to expect, it makes them feel more secure in what they&rsquo;re doing.</li>
<li><strong>Our services are not for you if …</strong> uses the old &lsquo;you want what you can&rsquo;t have&rsquo; psychology trick as well as weeding out the people who aren&rsquo;t in your target market.</li>
<li><strong>Guarantee</strong> – See why you should offer a guarantee at <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/02/09/a-question-of-money-back-guarantees-and-marketing-your-online-products/">http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/02/09/a-question-of-money-back-guarantees-and-marketing-your-online-products/</a></li>
<li><strong>Plans &amp; Pricing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Limited Offer</strong> (time or quantity) – after they&rsquo;ve just signed up to your email course we give them a time or quantity limited offer of a discount to the paid service. Creates a sense of urgency and special status.</li>
<li><strong>FAQs</strong> – here&rsquo;s where you answer every conceivable objection you think someone may have about using your service.</li>
<li><strong>P.S.</strong> – People can&rsquo;t resist reading the P.S. so take advantage of this and repeat your call to action here.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tips for designing the home page and the sales page</h4>

<ul>
<li>Each section of content should be separated visually by the layout of the copy or background color or other visual indicators. Use arrows or shapes to direct the reader to the next section.</li>
<li>If you use an image—faces are best and they are ideally looking towards the text.</li>
<li>Video can help increase conversions. Use <a href="http://www.powtoon.com/">http://www.powtoon.com/</a> to create a quick and dirty explainer video. You can always improve it later.</li>
<li>Call-to-action button is big. Orange is a good color to start with, but as long as it&rsquo;s a different color to the rest of the page to stand out.</li>
<li>Personal story has photo of owner and/or team if available.</li>
<li>Testimonials to include photos if available</li>
<li>Use hand drawn arrows to draw attention to main call-to-action.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tips on performance and hosting</h4>

<p>The speed in which your landing pages (and website) download in your visitors browsers is very important. You can optimise your website for speed by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minifying and combining your Javascript and CSS files to reduce the size and number of HTTP requests.</li>
<li>Optimise images using <a href="https://tinyjpg.com/">https://tinyjpg.com/</a></li>
<li>Using a CDN like <a href="https://cdnify.com/">https://cdnify.com/</a> if you host the website yourself or make sure your hosting provider uses a CDN.</li>
</ul>

<p>For free, very fast and very reliable hosting I recommend using GitHub Pages at <a href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a></p>

<p>If you want a blog I recommend Siteleaf at <a href="http://www.siteleaf.com/">http://www.siteleaf.com/</a> which I use for my own website at <a href="http://www.davidcrowther.com">http://www.davidcrowther.com</a> – beautiful and usable interface and your website is saved as static files when published for speed and security.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re more comfortable using WordPress, then use a hosting service like <a href="http://wpengine.com/">http://wpengine.com/</a> or <a href="https://pagely.com/">https://pagely.com/</a></p>

<p>And of course make sure your website is &lsquo;responsive&rsquo; so it&rsquo;s usable on smartphones and tablets.</p>

<h3>The Email Course</h3>

<p>As soon as a visitor has signed up for the email course they&rsquo;re sent a welcome email which:</p>

<ul>
<li>is warm and friendly like a personal note to a friend,</li>
<li>lays out what to expect from the course,</li>
<li>reminds them about the time or quantity limited discount on offer (including a direct link to the sales page).</li>
<li>and also asks them to white list you.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can make the email course as long as you like but I recommend at least five emails in your course.</p>

<p>Also, include one or more &lsquo;bonus&rsquo; emails as it follows the under promise, over deliver theme which is always a winner.</p>

<p>Use your name in the “From” field, instead of, or as well as the name of the company. Remember, conversations are between people, not faceless companies.</p>

<p>Sign off your emails with your name and contact details. Add a P.S. with &ldquo;Just click reply to ask me a question, your message will come directly to my personal inbox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Make sure you’re monitoring any replies to your email campaigns as this is the perfect opportunity to learn more about your customers needs and wants.</p>

<p>In choosing an email service provider (ESP) I recommend Customer.io at <a href="http://customer.io/">http://customer.io/</a> as they allow you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Send normal email campaigns like you would with MailChimp.</li>
<li>Send autoresponder campaign, also like MailChimp does.</li>
<li>But you can also segment subscribers and trigger campaigns based on events. Events can be any action taken by users like when someone upgrades to a paid account, clicks on a link in an email, or even when they take no action like sending a member a reminder email  if they have a period of inactivity.</li>
<li>You can also A/B test every emails subject line and email content—this is very useful and something you should always be doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows you to send the right messages to the right people at the right time.</p>

<h4>Email marketing tip</h4>

<p>For all your email campaigns, I would highly recommend plain text emails (or HTML that looks like a plain text email) over image based emails. For the majority of the tests I&rsquo;ve performed, the plain text version was the winner. </p>

<p>If you think about all the emails you&rsquo;ve received that had images, I bet they were trying to sell you something. This association has made people immediately wary with image based emails. </p>

<p>The plain text email in comparison—like the ones you receive from your friends and family—you&rsquo;re happy to read first and then make judgment.</p>

<h2>Measurement &amp; Analysis</h2>

<p>What gets measured gets improved. I&rsquo;m not sure who was the first person to say that quote, but they&rsquo;re right.</p>

<p>So we want to measure from your traffic generation down to your customer lifetime value and everything in-between. </p>

<p>For the paid advertising we need to add the correct campaign URLs to every ad that&rsquo;s displayed.</p>

<p>You can learn more about tagging at <a href="http://www.annielytics.com/guides/definitive-guide-campaign-tagging-google-analytics/">http://www.annielytics.com/guides/definitive-guide-campaign-tagging-google-analytics/</a></p>

<p>In the article there&rsquo;s a link to a helpful spreadsheet to track all these URLs.</p>

<p>For website analytics there&rsquo;s the popular Google Analytics. But along with GA (or alternative to) I would recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heap for tracking everything and easy funnel reporting - <a href="https://heapanalytics.com/">https://heapanalytics.com/</a></li>
<li>Chartbeat for tacking popular blog posts - <a href="https://chartbeat.com/for-everyone/">https://chartbeat.com/for-everyone/</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Further Recommendations</h2>

<p><strong>1. Start immediately with just a landing page and email course.</strong> This allows you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>immediately validate your idea (do you have something people want),</li>
<li>optimise your paid advertising campaigns,</li>
<li>optimise your landing page,</li>
<li>solicit feedback from prospective customers, </li>
<li>build your email list.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that while you&rsquo;re still building your actual service.</p>

<p><strong>2. Find a friend or colleague and offer to walk them through your service for free.</strong> Most people won&rsquo;t say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this.</p>

<p>In return, you agree that they&rsquo;ll give you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uncensored feedback. Your guinea pig needs to tear your offering apart. What did they like? What would they improve? Get as much detailed, actionable feedback as possible. Get them on a phone call or take them for coffee if you need to. And never stop asking questions.</li>
<li>A testimonial. You want a testimonial to display on the sales page. During the feedback, make sure you take note of anything positive, write it down, and compile a testimonial for the person. Nobody likes writing testimonials, so you write down what they said, repeat it back to them, and ask to use it as a testimonial.</li>
<li>Experience. Review the process, expand on what worked, weed out what didn&rsquo;t and refine your offering even further before you launch.</li>
</ul>
