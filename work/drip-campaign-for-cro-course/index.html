  <p>I wrote a series of emails for a CRO course.</p>

<p>In total there were 8 emails in this autoresponder series.</p>

<p>Below is one of the emails in the sequence:</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Newsletters</strong></p>

<p>Once upon a time there were two business men—Johnny Wright and Larry de Losser.</p>

<p>Now, both Johnny and Larry sold eyewear for canines—nothing but the finest quality of glasses for the most discerning of pooches.</p>

<p>They were both looking to increase their sales and become the top dog (pardon the pun) in their industry.</p>

<p>Larry decided to spend all of his budget on advertising, to bring as many people as possible to his website peek-a-pooch.com.</p>

<p>Johnny, on the other hand, set up a newsletter list and added a sign-up form on his website designer-doggy.com.</p>

<p>To help increase sign-ups to his newsletter, Johnny clearly described the benefits (not features) his readers would receive from his emails. He also offered a 24 page guide entitled, ‘How to Select the Most Flattering Frames for Your Dog’s Face Shape’.</p>

<p>While Larry received more visitors to his website, Johnny sent regular newsletters to his website visitors who had subscribed, as well as to those who had previously purchased from him.</p>

<p>Johnny made sure each of his newsletters was jam packed with useful information and tips, and did not try to sell a thing. He understood that the most important thing was to build trust and educate, so that when the time came when his subscribers were ready to buy their dog some glasses, his name would be the first one that sprang to mind.</p>

<p>Now, at the beginning Larry had 10,000 visitors coming to his website every month. But due to his advertising, he was soon getting 20,000 visitors per month.</p>

<p>As he on average made 1 sale (worth $100) out of every 100 visitors, he had increased his monthly revenue from what was initially $10,000 up to $20,000. But due to his additional monthly advertising costs of $5,000, he profited $15,000 per month.</p>

<p>Johnny also started with 10,000 visitors per month and that remained unchanged. But due to the subscriptions to his regular newsletter, his conversion rate doubled from 1 sale out of every 100 visitors to 2 sales out of every 100 visitors.</p>

<p>Not only that, but his newsletter subscribers—who were by now extremely in-the-know re the benefits of his glasses for dogs—made not 1, but 2 purchases on average (worth $200 per customer) further increasing his revenue to a total of $40,000 per month.</p>

<p>It’s a great story. But I have a confession to make. I made it up. Yes, I know … it’s hard to believe that Larry and Johnny didn’t really sell doggy glasses.</p>

<p>But the benefits of newsletter marketing are very real, and I hope this story has opened your eyes to the business advantages focused newsletter marketing can give your company.</p>

<p>The question is: Are you Johnny Wright or Larry de Losser?</p>
