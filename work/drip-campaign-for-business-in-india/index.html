  <p>I wrote a series of emails for a client who worked with companies that needed help expanding into India.</p>

<p>In total there were 16 emails in this autoresponder series.</p>

<p>Below is the cold email and two emails in the sequence:</p>

<h2>Cold Email</h2>

<p>Subject: Congrats on the move to India! </p>

<p>Hello [First name],</p>

<p>I heard recently that your organization is moving into the Indian market. That&rsquo;s great— usually I&rsquo;m pretty up-to-date on these things, but I didn&rsquo;t know about it until now. Is this a recent decision?</p>

<p>I hope it&rsquo;s going smoothly. I know a lot of companies have seen strong initial success followed by a gradual decline (especially since 2008). It&rsquo;s a tricky market to work in, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m contacting you because I run an organization that helps Western companies adapt to working in the Eastern marketplaces (specifically, India). MARWAS AG has been the bridge to India for dozens of major companies, providing them with the contacts, expertise, and cultural intelligence necessary to build successful projects.</p>

<p>We also run trainings for all levels of staff and facilitate study trips to India itself. There&rsquo;s a lot we could do to help your Indian venture succeed.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested, let me know. If replying to this email doesn&rsquo;t work, you can always reach me here: [Client website URL]</p>

<p>All the best, talk to you soon— </p>

<p>[Client name]</p>

<p>P.s. I&rsquo;m Swiss-born, of Indian descent, and fluent in English, German, Hindi, and Urdu, so bouncing between cultures comes fairly easily to me. That&rsquo;s why I enjoy this work so much —but I understand why people usually feel uncomfortable in strange new surroundings. If you feel awkward in India or if your project feels out-of-place somehow, please give me a call! I&rsquo;d love to talk about it.</p>

<h2>Email 6</h2>

<p>Subject: Napoleon&rsquo;s Big Mistake (And How You Can Avoid Making It Too)</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France and military genius, was one of the most brilliant leaders that the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>And yet he failed in his goal, and was overthrown. Why?
There&rsquo;s a story about the battle of Waterloo, where Napoleon&rsquo;s army was finally defeated. The general found a guide, a local farmer, who knew the lay of the land where the battle was to be fought. He trusted this guide when making plans for battle.</p>

<p>What he didn&rsquo;t know was that the farmer was secretly a royalist, an enemy of the revolution. And so when Napoleon proposed to charge his heavy cavalry down a slope and into the English lines, the farmer said it was a good idea.</p>

<p>What Napoleon couldn&rsquo;t see was that a narrow road lay at the bottom of the slope, hidden in a ravine. The farmer knew about it, but he didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>And so the cream of the French army charged full-speed into a ravine, where they were promptly slaughtered by the English forces. It was one of the turning points of the battle.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the lesson here? (Hint: it&rsquo;s not just a military lesson, but a business one as well.)</p>

<p>No matter how brilliant you (or your product) is, you can be undone on unfamiliar ground if you don&rsquo;t choose your guides well.</p>

<p>You need someone who knows the territory … and who you can trust. Why not pick one of the most trusted names in East-West project management?</p>

<p>Until next time,<br>

<h2>Email 7</h2>

<p>Subject: Cross-Cultural Indian Business Trainings Now Available!</p>

<p>Doing business in India doesn&rsquo;t have to be difficult. All you need is the right knowledge and the right mindset.</p>

<p>And now, you can get both of those things in the same place.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that my popular MARWAS trainings are open once again through 2014.</p>

<p>These trainings are the industry standard in building cross-cultural business knowledge (sure, anybody can say that, but not everyone has a client list that covers as many industries in as much depth as ours does). You&rsquo;re going to come away from this training with exactly the skills you need to succeed, and exactly the right mindset to implement them with.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my promise, to you.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to cover things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>How India&rsquo;s business culture differs from the West, and how it&rsquo;s similar</li>
<li>How to make use of those commonalities to forge strong business relationships</li>
<li>How to help your organization be measurably more successful on the subcontinent by
the end of 2014</li>
<li>And much more …</li>
</ul>

<p>I usually get booked up extremely quickly as soon as I send out this email each year … so if your business needs the competitive edge in India in 2014 make sure to contact me right away! I&rsquo;d hate for you to miss out (and have to wait a whole extra year!).</p>

<p>Follow this link to learn more about our trainings, how they can benefit you (and your organization), and how to schedule one yourself. Don&rsquo;t wait too long, or there won&rsquo;t be any spots left!</p>

<p>Until next time,<br>
[Client name]</p>
